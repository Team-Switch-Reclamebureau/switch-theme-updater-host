# Switch Theme Updater Host

The host authenticates Switch Updater clients, brokers GitHub package updates,
and securely retains short-lived sanitized clone artifacts for authorized host
administrators.

## SSL certificate column

The Client Sites table includes an SSL column (also available in Screen Options).
It checks only the first registered URL's hostname, using TLS on port 443, or the
explicit port for an HTTPS URL. HTTP redirects and other registered URLs are not
followed.

Let's Encrypt certificates display `Let's Encrypt`. Other certificates display
the number of complete days remaining; negative values indicate expiration.
Click the SSL heading to sort numerically in either direction, with Let's
Encrypt, pending checks, and failed checks placed after certificates with a
day count. Hover over the result to see the issuer and expiration date.

Checks run through WP-Cron when the table is opened, with results refreshed after
24 hours (failed checks after one hour). The last result and its check time stay
visible while a refresh is pending. Reload the table after WP-Cron runs to see
new results, or use **Check SSL** in a cell to check that site immediately.
PHP OpenSSL and stream sockets are required; failures are shown in the column.
This inspects certificate metadata, including expired or untrusted certificates;
it does not certify chain trust or hostname validity.

Run the standalone regression checks with `php tests/ssl-column.php`. They cover
issuer detection, expiry sorting, caching, and certificate capture against a
temporary local TLS server.

## Clone job progress

The authenticated `GET /clones/{job_id}` status response includes a `stage`
field. New and claimed jobs begin at `queued`; clients report
`exporting`, `uploading_database`, `archiving_theme`, `uploading_theme`,
`archiving_parent_theme`, `uploading_parent_theme`, and `finalizing` through
the authenticated client progress endpoint. This lets clone consumers show the
current operation while the job status remains `claimed`.

When a client administrator cancels an active clone, the client reports
`Cancellation requested from client plugin.` through the authenticated failure
endpoint. The host changes the claimed job to `failed`, records that message,
and removes its uploaded artifact parts.

## Child-theme clone support

Clone-job status returns a `package_inventory` containing the active theme and,
when it is a child theme, its required parent theme. Theme inventory entries use
`active` and `required` respectively, allowing clone consumers to reconstruct
both theme dependencies.

For unmanaged themes, clone jobs retain separate verified ZIP artifacts:

- Active theme: `theme_artifact_sha256`, `theme_artifact_size`, and
  `theme_stylesheet`, downloaded from `/clones/{job_id}/theme-download`.
- Required parent theme: `parent_theme_artifact_sha256`,
  `parent_theme_artifact_size`, and `parent_theme_stylesheet`, downloaded from
  `/clones/{job_id}/parent-theme-download`.

Both endpoints require an authenticated host administrator, serve only `ready`,
unexpired jobs, and set `Cache-Control: no-store`. Artifacts expire after 24
hours. The established single active-theme artifact and endpoint remain
available for compatibility with older clients and consumers.
